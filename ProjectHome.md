Script Connector is an application connector that allows web services to be implemented in JavaScript. The script runs inside the application connector (i.e. it has no relation to the front-end or the browser). This way a prototype of a real web service can be modeled quickly and usually this connector is used for creating web service stubs where the script returns a fixed response that emulates the real back-end.

A typical use case is creating stub methods for an external web service. In this case the Cordys method set for these external methods is created using the UDDI method generator, this method set is attached to the Script Connector SOAP node and scripts are created for these methods. When the real web service is available, the method set can be attached to the UDDI SOAP node and the real web service can be accessed.
