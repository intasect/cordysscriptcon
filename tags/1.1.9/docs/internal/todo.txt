Need to add test cases for these issues:

	High prio:
	* SOAP response element name is now read from the WSDL (if available).
	* Added new method: Cordys.getResponseMessage().removeChildElementNamespaces
	- (Routescript) Response method name lookup sometimes failed when script routed the request to another organization.
	* If a SOAP response received from an external web service does not contain a SOAP method in the SOAP body, the connector does not return a SOAP method either.
	* ScriptSoapMessages does not add the SOAP namespace declarations anymore to the top level nodes (header and body).
	
	Medium prio:
	- Script configuration file is now checked for modification before each script execution and the scripts are reloaded if the file has been changed.
	- A custom property file can be specified in the connector configuration page. 
	- Added a new method throwing a SOAP faults: throwSoapFault(String, String, String, String)
	- Added support for saving ScriptConnector SOAP transactions 
	* Cordys.setResponseMethodName()
	* Cordys.setResponseMethodNamespace()
	- Added script pre-processor class. This can be configured per-method (* supported) in the configuration file. 

	Low prio:
	- Relative script locations in the configuration file now are relative to the connector installation folder.
	- The javascript files in the config.properties file are now relative to the directory of the config.properties file.
	- Configuration file specified in the configuration page can be now relative in which case it is relative to the connector installation folder.
